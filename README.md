# Boston-House-Price-Predictions
📊 In this project, I explored a housing dataset using Python's data analysis and machine learning libraries. I employed various regression models to predict housing prices based on different features. 

🔍 After loading and preprocessing the dataset, including handling outliers and performing feature selection, I used three different regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

📈 The Linear Regression model achieved an accuracy of 63% in predicting housing prices, while the Random Forest model outperformed it with an accuracy of 85%. Finally, the XGBoost model demonstrated the highest accuracy of 89%, indicating its superior predictive power for this dataset.

💡 This project showcases the importance of selecting appropriate machine learning models for accurate predictions. The Random Forest and XGBoost models, with their ensemble learning techniques, proved to be highly effective in capturing complex relationships within the data and achieving superior accuracy in predicting housing prices.

👨‍💻 By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we can gain valuable insights into real estate markets and make informed decisions. I'm excited to continue exploring and applying these techniques to solve more real-world problems!"
